# Table & Figure Extraction Approach

Handle non-text content that's critical for understanding papers.

## Goals
- Extract tables and convert to structured formats (CSV, JSON, Markdown)
- Generate natural language descriptions of figures
- Preserve numerical data and relationships
- Create alt-text for visual elements

## Key Challenges
- Detecting table boundaries in PDFs
- Handling complex table structures (merged cells, hierarchies)
- Extracting figures from raster PDFs
- Generating meaningful figure descriptions
- Preserving numerical precision

## Implementation Notes
