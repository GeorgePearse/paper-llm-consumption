# Semantic Parsing Approach

Extract and structure semantic elements for better LLM comprehension.

## Goals
- Identify and tag key concepts (theorems, definitions, lemmas, results)
- Extract algorithm descriptions
- Parse experimental setups and results
- Create structured knowledge representations

## Key Challenges
- Domain-specific terminology recognition
- Theorem and definition boundary detection
- Extracting structured algorithm descriptions
- Parsing experimental methodology sections
- Creating consistent semantic tagging

## Implementation Notes
(To be filled as work progresses)
