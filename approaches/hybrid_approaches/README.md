# Hybrid Approaches

Combine multiple techniques for optimal results.

## Goals
- Determine best combinations for different paper types
- Balance completeness vs. token efficiency
- Adaptive approaches based on paper characteristics
- Multi-stage processing pipelines

## Strategy
Hybrid approaches will test combinations such as:
- Markdown conversion + hierarchical chunking
- Semantic parsing + table extraction
- Citation networks + semantic enrichment
- Adaptive pipelines based on paper type and length

## Implementation Notes
(To be filled as work progresses)
