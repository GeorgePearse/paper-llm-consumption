# Hierarchical Chunking Approach

Intelligent splitting strategies that respect document structure rather than arbitrary token limits.

## Goals
- Chunk at semantic boundaries (sections, paragraphs)
- Preserve context relationships between chunks
- Optimize for specific context window sizes
- Maintain chunk metadata (source section, depth)

## Key Challenges
- Detecting semantic boundaries in text
- Balancing chunk sizes across different section types
- Maintaining coherence across chunk boundaries
- Handling nested hierarchies
- Preserving cross-references

## Implementation Notes
(To be filled as work progresses)
